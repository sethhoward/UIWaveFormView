UIWaveFormView
==============

A scrappy little project from 2010 that draws an AVAsset's wave form.

The real meat and potatoes lies in the method populateSampleViewWithAsset: the rest is just cruft. The current implementation only renders one channel and when panning/zooming runs like an old dog on retina devices.
